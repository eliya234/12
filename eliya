    <h2>Family Traditions & Culture</h2>
    <p>One of our most cherished family traditions is celebrating Passover (Pesach) with a big family dinner. Everyone comes together to read the Haggadah, eat traditional foods, and share stories. This tradition is important because it keeps our cultural heritage alive, and it brings the family together every year.</p>
